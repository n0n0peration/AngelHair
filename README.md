Please use this script against systems you have prior permission to run against. I am not responsible for the mis-use of this script.
I built this script as part of my OSCP cert and testing on Hack the Box. To help automate some of the more important commands I may 
run or need to run against different target machines in the lab. 
Future releases will include multiple IPs, more programs to auto scan through, and cleaner code.
